Run SC LogViewer 

Simple Log Monitoring Overlay for Star Citizen 

Click Start (bottom left)
	Select Star Citizen install folder. I.e "LIVE" or "PTU" ( this will be saved as default next time. Can be changed in file menu. 

# Hotkeys:
# (Mouse has to be focused on the log viewer for them to work currently)

# ctrl q = chart window : shows the chart of the word occurrences
# ctrl w = add word fast : adds selected word to list of search words 
# ctrl e = word manager : shows the word manager window
# ctrl f = search word : searches for the selected word, highlights all occurrences in yellow and shows a count of the occurrences


# PlayTime Calculator (inside "Extras") is just a tool that listens for any input. 
I use it to see how much time is wasted during testing.
If there is no input for more than 1 second it starts counting time spent idle. 
It stops when any input is received. (be careful as the button to open it in the log viewer will open multiple instances)
